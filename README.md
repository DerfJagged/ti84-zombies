# ti84-zombies
A Nazi Zombies game for Ti84 calculators

[Nazi Zombies Build 1.0 Readme]

Thanks for downloading my game! I hope you enjoy it.
In this build, ammo is unlimited although you can you can spend points to buy it from the mystery box.
This is so I can test the game quicker. Source will be released after completion of the following.


Known issues to be fixed in next version:
----------------------------------------
-Wall pixels get deleted when shooting wunderwaffe and sniper against a wall
-Ammo text overwrites borders when >99

To-do list:
----------
-Add 4 difficulties which affect zombie speed and health
-Slowly spawn zombies rather than all at once, also spawn them from left side
-Draw map via hex code
-Drop a text hint at level 25 as to what the cheat code for the game is!
-Optimize code (could be optimized a LOT)

Rough Yearly Changelog:
---------------
2009 - Built game, menus, and graphics in BASIC
2010 - Rebuilt entire game in AXE
2011 - Added other 3 weapons, mystery box, points system, zombie pathfinding
2017 - Picked game up again, squashed a few pathfinding bugs
